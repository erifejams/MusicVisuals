# Music Visualiser Project

Name: Erifeoluwa O Jamgbadi

Student Number:  C18387973

# Description of the assignment
My assignment a visual art piece. My assignment responds to the music that is playing.The music, I picked are kpop songs from a boyband called BTS. I was inspired by BTS(korean artist group) stage preformances and the beat of the song, which is dionysus and a bit of a verse from ddaeng. This is a 2D project.  There are differnt shapes such as squares, circles visuals etc reacting to the music by changing colors and shapes. I watched their different stage preformances and the energy from it, inspired me to make the different visuals, that I created.

I implemented individual files. Each file has, it's own *creation* and the names of the file signifies what visual, it is. I have about 9 visuals, which are all 2D. Some of the new techniques, that I had to learn, that are contained in this file are sin, cos, scale, rose mathematics.

# Instructions
- Fork this repository 
- In the individual files, you will find the code for each of the visuals e.g. circlevisual, that I implemented 
- all the individual files are brought together by myVisual.java, so press F5, when you want to compile/run the file
- Press the keys specified under the heading *how it works* to shift/go through the desired visual files

# How it works
- UP =
- DOWN =
- TAB =
- RIGHT =
- LEFT =

# What I am most proud of in the assignment
What I am most proud of in the assigment are:
1. How some of my visuals react to the colours and make the visual stand out and look beautiful.

1. How some of my visuals react to the music and change shapes accordingly.

1. The rose mathemathics, that I learnt from a youtuber and wikipedia, but instead of using vertex, i used the circle for a type of rose/circle visual *(r = cos((k)(theta)))*

1. How all my individual files came together and interacts, when different keys, that I specified are pressed.

1. Learnt how to use inheritance and polymorphism and apply it to the code in some ways

1. The imagery, that I created in the visuals.

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
